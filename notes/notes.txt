Notes on reproducibility
-----------------------------

Notes on data
- README fairly clear and specifies what results in article come from where in data
- For reproducibility, nice to give questions numbers to easily refer to questions independent from excel row numbers
- Data structure unsuitable for tools other than excel
- "Hidden" columns in excel files with notes on uncertainties in data collection (e.g. between sub 4 and 5). Not mentioned in readme or article
- For subject 3, no data for q5 and 5-10% (uncertain answer) on q6
- Further no mention of how above point was handled in README or article
- q5 and q6 should be NAN to match mean/median reported (other values skew mean/median away from reported statistics)
- When properly setting up data removing hidden columns and q5-6, means and medians all match those reported
- Ranges on p5149 of article not referred to in README
- Wrong minimum number of projects worked on by participants on p5149 (should be 15 not 25)

Notes on figures
- Some figure axis texts not identical to figures in excel file, this was edited elsewhere
