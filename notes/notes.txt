Notes on reproducibility

- README fairly clear and specifies what results come from where in data
- For reproducibility, nice to give questions numbers so variable name does not need to be a paragraph
- Data structure unsuitable for tools other than excel (hidden columns with notes on uncertain answers, 5.1, 10.1)
- For subject 3, no data for q5 and 5-10% on q6
- Further no mention of how above point was handled in README or article
- q5 and q6 should be NAN to match mean/median reported
- When properly setting up data removing hidden columns and q5-6, means and medians all match
- Ranges on p5149 not referred to in README
- Wrong minimum number of projects (15 not 25)
